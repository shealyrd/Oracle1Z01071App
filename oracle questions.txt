Which statement is correct?
CREATE TABLE my employees (company_id VARCHAR);
CREATE TABLE my_employees (company_id VAR_CHAR);
CREATE TABLE "my_employees" (company_id VAR_CHAR);
CREATE TABLE "my employees" (company_id VARCHAR);
CREATE TABLE my_employees VALUES (company id VARCHAR);
CREATE TABLE my_employees VALUES ("company id" VARCHAR);

Given table:
CREATE TABLE my_employees (company_id NUMBER(3,2);

Which statement will work?

INSERT INTO VALUES...

 TIMESTAMP(n) This is an extension of DATE that adds fractional second precision.
 
 TIMESTAMP(n) WITH TIME ZONE This is a variation of TIMESTAMP that adds either a time zone region name or an offset for time zone. 
 
 TIMESTAMP(n) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE This is a variation of TIMESTAMP. The TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE differs from TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE in that the time zone offset is not stored with the column’s value, and the value retrieved is sent to the user in the user’s local session time zone.
 
 INTERVAL YEAR(n) TO MONTH This stores a span of time defined in only year and month values, where n is the number of digits used to define the YEAR value. 
 
 INTERVAL DAY(n1) TO SECOND(n2) This stores a span of time defined in days, hours, minutes, and seconds, where n1 is the precision for days, and n2 is the precision for seconds. 
 
 Tables may have multiple columns with LOB data types. However, LOBs cannot be primary keys, and they cannot be used with DISTINCT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, or joins.
 
 BLOB   The name BLOB is an abbreviation for “binary large object.” BLOB accepts large binary objects, such as image or video files. Declaration is made without precision or scale. (The maximum size is calculated by way of a formula that includes several items not on the exam, including a starting size of 4GB, something called the CHUNK parameter, and the setting for the database block size, which is a setting that affects all storage in the database.)
 
CLOB   The name CLOB is an abbreviation for “character large object.” CLOB accepts large text data elements. Declaration is made without precision or scale, and the maximum size is calculated in the same manner that it is for the BLOB data type.

NCLOB   This accepts CLOB data in Unicode. The maximum size is calculated in the same manner that it is for the BLOB data type.

CREATE TABLE: In-Line Constraints

CREATE TABLE: Out-of-Line Constraints

The NOT NULL constraint cannot be created out of line. In other words, this is invalid:

The list of certification objectives specifically states that you will be tested on the topic of creating constraints at the time of table creation. This can include any one of the in-line or out-of-line combinations for any constraint. The syntax is tricky. Study it thoroughly and know it well.

      select count(*) from 
      (select 100 + NULL as res from dual)
      where res is NULL
