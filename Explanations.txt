{"explanation":"To truncate a table, the table must be in your schema or you must have DROP ANY TABLE system privilege.\n\nTRUNCATE TABLE is a DDL statement and therefore performs an implicit commit.\n\nThe TABLE keyword is required when trying to TRUNCATE a table.

{"explanation":"Line 6 inserts the number 1 into my_table_1.my_id. Because there is no corresponding row in my_table_2.my_id which references that row, then there is no referential integrity error.

Therefore, line 6 has not been committed after line 7.","id":107},
{"explanation":"TRUNCATE statements fail only when performed on the PARENT table of a FOREIGN KEY constraint.

{"explanation":"If you leave out columns in your INSERT INTO... VALUES... statement, all excluded columns will be set to null. Therefore, Nullable columns are optional in an INSERT INTO...

{"explanation":"This question concerns the fact that line 4 inserts a CHAR value into my_id, which is has NUMBER data type.

{"explanation":"This question concerns the fact that line 4 inserts a NUMBER value into my_id, which is has CHAR data type.

//115 clear up ambiguity in "After line 6, there are two records in my_table."
{"explanation":"Official Oracle docs: \"Unless a NOT NULL constraint is also defined, a null always satisfies a unique key constraint. Thus, columns with both unique key constraints and NOT NULL constraints are typical. This combination forces the user to enter values in the unique key and eliminates the possibility that new row data conflicts with existing row data.\"\n\nKeep in mind that NULL = NULL never evaluates to TRUE or FALSE, but rather to UNKNOWN.\n\nAfter line 6, there are 3 rows in the table: two NULL rows and one row containing 'A'.\n\nThere are no COMMIT or DDL statements at or after line 3, so it could not be committed.","id":115},

{"explanation":"This question concerns the DDL status of the GRANT and CREATE USER statements.\n\nThe GRANT statement on line 5 performs an implicit commit, saving the 'A' value inserted in line 4 and causing it to not be reverted by the ROLLBACK on line 6. Thus, when line 7 attempts to insert 'A' into my_id, the UNIQUE constraint on that column is violates, causing an error.\n\nLine 8 attempts to create a USER named my_user, even though we already created a USER object with the same name in line 1. The ROLLBACK in line 6 does not undo the CREATE USER statement in line 1 because (a) CREATE USER is a DDL statement and can't be rolled back and (b) there is an implicit commit at line 5 so even if CREATE USER were a DML statement, line 1 would still be saved.","id":119},

//maybe at some point include more practice on ascii table weights, and general sorting weight information for all datatypes
//add some practice on oracle boolean truth tables with unknown
{"explanation":"A descending order means that the highest ranking values are returned first.\n\nOracle sorts based on ASCII weights. In ASCII, all uppercase letters come before all lowercase letters and therefore have  lower weights. So 'me' would return before 'You' in a descending sort because a lowercase 'm' has a higher weight than an uppercase 'Y'.\n\nOracle weights later dates higher, so January 2nd 2000 returns before January 1st 2000 in a descending sort.\n\n'You' is weighted higher than 'Me' in a descending sort because uppercase 'Y' comes after uppercase 'M'. Therefore, 'Me' does not return before 'You'.\n\nIt is important to realize that '100' and '50' are taken as CHARACTER data, not numbers, and as such are weighted only by their first character. Because '5' obviously comes after '1', '50' would return before '100' in a descending sort.\n\nNUMBER values take their weight as straight numerical comparisons, so 2 obviously weights higher than 1 and would be returned first in a descending sort.","id":140},

{"explanation":"This question concerns the behavior of NULL values. \n\nWhen the SELECT statement executes, my_table will have the following entries: ['my_data1', NULL, 'my_data3'].\n\nFor a record to pass the WHERE clause in the SELECT statement, it must evaluate to true either in my_data = NULL or my_data = 'my_data3'. Obviously 'my_data1' doesn't fit either of these, so it is excluded. \n\nThe main point of this question is that NULL = NULL does NOT evaluate to TRUE. It evaluates to UNKNOWN. So the NULL entry in my_table does not pass the WHERE clause. \n\nWhen 'my_data3' is passed in, the boolean logic is calculated as such:\n\n('my_data3' = NULL OR 'my_data3' = 'my_data3')\n\nwhich becomes\n\n(UNKNOWN OR TRUE).\n\nThe Oracle truth tables calculate (UNKNOWN OR TRUE) as TRUE, so 'my_data3' passes the WHERE condition and is the only value to do so.","id":142},
