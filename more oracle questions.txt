A CONSTAINT can be applied to which of the below object types?

One of your report writers was testing some SQL logic in a report query and substituted another SELECT statement for one of the tables in the FROM clause. This is an example of what kind of subquery? (Choose all that apply.)

You can use a subquery to solve which of the following tasks?

You want to check whether customers placing an online order today placed any online orders in the previous week. What kind of subquery could you use to easily retrieve that list of customers?
- A single-row subquery
- A multiple-column subquery
- A multiple-row subquery
- A correlated subquery
- A scalar subquery

B, C, and D are correct. You are comparing two columns in the ORDERS table (CUSTOMER_ID and ORDER_DATE) with ORDER_DATE today to the same two columns in the ORDERS or ORDER_HISTORY table with ORDER_DATEs from last week. Either a multiple-column subquery using IN or a correlated subquery where the subquery references the same two columns in the parent query will work.

Select the correct order for the following steps in which the Oracle engine processes a query with a correlated subquery:

1. The WHERE clause is evaluated for the inner query.
2. The query is parsed to check object existence and permissions.
3. The WHERE clause is evaluated for the outer query.
4. For each row in the outer query, return matching rows in the inner query.
5. For each row in the inner query, return matching rows in the outer query.
6. Repeat the process for each row in the inner or outer query.




Your developer wrote a query to show who is boss and who is your boss's boss.

select l1.employee_id low_id, l1.last_name low_last_name,
   l2.employee_id med_id, l2.last_name med_last_name,
   l3.employee_id high_id, l3.last_name high_last_name
from hr.employees l1
   left outer join hr.employees l2 on l1.manager_id=l2.employee_id
      left outer join hr.employees l3 on l2.manager_id=l3.employee_id
order by l1.last_name;

As the DBA, you want to give other users SELECT access to all tables in the OE schema, so you create a role called OE_READ and run GRANT SELECT ON OE.<tablename> TO OE_READ for each table in the OE schema. Next, you run GRANT OE_READ TO HR.
